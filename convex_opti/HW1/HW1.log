I was expecting to see something like `(' or `\{' or

should probably delete the `{' by typing `1' now, so that
braces don't get unbalanced. Otherwise just proceed.

nonnegative, or you can use `\delimiter <delimiter code>'.

I've deleted a group-closing symbol because it seems to be
spurious, as in `$x}$'. But perhaps the } is legitimate and
you forgot something else, as in `\hbox{$x}'. In such cases
the way to recover is to insert both the forgotten and the
deleted material, e.g., by typing `I$}'.
